Rock Paper Scissors

create variables for rock, paper and scissor
create function getComputerChoice
function will generate a random result out of 1, 2 and 3
IF the result equals 1 then return rock
ELSE IF result equals 2 then return paper 
ELSE return scissor


create new function getHumanChoice
user will input rock, paper or scissor
return that user input

create variables humanScore and computerScore and set to 0

Now create function to play the game
create function playRound
Define parameters for playRound
The parameters will have getHumanChoice and getComputerChoice result stored

Then create code needed for game
IF humanChoice equals rock and computerChoice equals rock
Its a draw, donÂ´t increase scores
ELSE IF humanChoice equals rock and computerChoice equals paper
computer wins, increase scores

continue this with all logics 


Create function playGame 
It includes the playRound function and move score variables to the function
create for loop to play 5 games
in for loop set the const humanSelection and computerSelection to the get methods
console.log after each iteration to show round and score after each round

create if statement to get the winner
IF humanScore bigger than computerScore 
console.log show winner and score of you and computer
ELSE IF humanScore smaller than computerScore
console.log show that you lost and show scores of you and computer
ELSE 
console.log show that the game is a tie and show both scores

Finally start with playGame() to start the game
